# papers
This repo is containing notes and implementation for cherry-picked publications of my particular interest.

My notes and interpretation are fully personal and might not reflect the authors ideas.
The code is available as-is and meant for me to better understand the papers and check the results - if you want to take it, or/and improve it, you are welcome!
